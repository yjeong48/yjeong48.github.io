  <h2>Where am I exactly from?</h2>
  <p>I was born in India and actually lived there until I graduated high school! Currently, I am in South Korea for personal reasons. A lot of people get surprised by this and I think it is a unique background too!<p>
  <p>One of the most frequent questions I get asked is if I had any challenges living in a foreign country. Too be honest, although my nationality is different, I can say my hometown is in India and that being said, India is not really a foreign country to me.</p>
  <p>I actually want to show you the beautiful sky I truly enjoyed while living there.</p>
